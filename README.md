## Purpose

I built this project to practice building and integrating backend APIs with the front end. I used express.js for the backend to build a REST API to serve, store, and delete each note. There is no user auth, if I continue developing the application, that is the feature I would add next.

## Functional Description

This app allows the user to add, view, and delete notes from a db. The user can interact with the application in the following ways:
- View notes by clicking on a note on the left side of the screen
- Add notes by clicking on the plus icon in the top right, filling in the note title and text fields, then clicking the save icon in the top right
- Delete nots by clicking on the trash can icon next to a note on the left
